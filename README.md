# Vim Awesome Configuration

## Requirements
* Vim (of course)
* Python support

## Installation
It's as simple as that:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ivyl/vim-config.git ~/.vim
cd ~/.vim
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Newer Vim is fine with $HOME/.vim/vimrc. If you use older one that doens't
support that feature (check :help vimrc) you need to:

```bash
ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
```
